# My toughts on this project

- I tried to use Zustand for state management (Mabye you remember, I mentioned when we met in office)
it was very interesting, (used it for first time here): https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand 
- Overall I tried to make this project very light, no router, super basic components, used react-table library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-table), no high end css styling.
- BUT, I am not sure, if this is what you had in mind, I would be super happy if this work was satisfactory .. yet its simplistic to some degree and I am a bit afraid that it could not be enough. That is why, I included another big project on GitLab I worked on lately in email to *B.D.*.
- If you have any suggestions, questions or complaints, please I will be happy for your feedback.
